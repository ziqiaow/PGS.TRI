## Install R Package
The package can be easily installed from Github
```
library(devtools)
install_github("ziqiaow/PGS.TRI")
```

If you only want to use specific functions, you can also do this 
```
rm(list = ls())
require(devtools)
source_url("https://github.com/ziqiaow/PGS.TRI/blob/main/R/PGS-TRI.R?raw=TRUE")
source_url("https://github.com/ziqiaow/PGS.TRI/blob/main/R/simulation.R?raw=TRUE")

#If directly downloaded the R files from Github to your local directory 
source("./R/PGS-TRI.R")
source("./R/simulation.R")
```

## Required Data for the Analysis
The required data as input for this software are simple: PGS values for mothers, fathers, and children are needed. If PGSxE interactions are to be investigated, then a set of environmental variables for children are required. Note that only the environmental variables for interactions need to be prepared. By nature, our model is comparing within families so any environmental variables or confounders will be corrected (so no need to prepare data such as genetic principal components to include in the model input, unless your task is to look into PGS x children's PCs!). In math, the main effect of environmental variables in the likelihood are cancelled out in the numerator and denominator so it "automatically" corrects for any environmental variable in the disease model.

You can construct PGS for trios using pre-trained weights available on previously reported sources using external data, such as [PGScatalog](https://www.pgscatalog.org/), following steps described for unrelated individuals using softwares such as PLINK/2.0. Examples such as Autism Spectrum Disorders [PGS000327](https://www.pgscatalog.org/score/PGS000327/), Orofacial Clefts [PGS002266](https://www.pgscatalog.org/score/PGS002266/), Educational Attainment [PGS002012](https://www.pgscatalog.org/score/PGS002012/) can all be obtained freely online.

## Example Analysis
We provide a simple example for running our proposed method using simulated data. The R function of the proposed method is in [PGS-TRI](R/PGS-TRI.R). The R function to simulate data is available here [simulation](R/simulation.R). We also provide the R function to run the polygenic TDT (pTDT) test [pTDT](R/pTDT.R) (originally proposed by Weiner et al, Nat Genet. 2017). For PGSxE analysis, the case-only method is also implemented here [case-only](R/case-only.R) (Allison et al, AJE 2019; Wang et al, AJE 2024).

First simulate 200000 families based on a population disease risk model following a logistic regression with PGS main effect, two independent environmental variables $E_1$ (binary) and $E_2$ (continuous), and their interaction effect with PGS. Assume the marginal disease prevalence is Pr(D=1)=0.01.
```
